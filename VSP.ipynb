        "## **📌 Route Optimization Project using Clustering and VSP Algorithms**  \n",
        "**Author:** Pedro Miguel Figueroa Domínguez  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **📖 Introduction**  \n",
        "This project is designed to **optimize visit routes** to different geographical locations using **clustering algorithms and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solution**. The process consists of two main steps:  \n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Clustering Points:**  \n",
        "   - A clustering algorithm groups locations into clusters with a **maximum of 281 points** each.  \n",
        "   - These clusters are assigned to different **agents** to distribute the workload.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Route Optimization (TSP):**  \n",
        "   - The **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm** is used to determine the optimal visiting order within each cluster.  \n",
        "   - The route is sorted based on the **shortest distance between points**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **⚙️ Prerequisites**  \n",
        "Before running the notebook, install the required Python libraries:  \n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "!pip install pandas googlemaps ortools folium openpyxl\n",
        "pip install folium pandas numpy scikit-learn geopy\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **🌍 Getting Coordinates (If Not Available in Your Data)**  \n",
        "If your dataset does not contain **latitude and longitude coordinates**, you can extract them using the **Google Maps API**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Steps to Obtain Coordinates**  \n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Download an Address Dataset (if needed)**  \n",
        "   - If you only have business names and addresses, your file should have structured address information.  \n",
        "   - Recommended format: CSV or Excel with columns like **Business Name, Address, City, Country**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Get a Google Maps API Key**  \n",
        "   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)  \n",
        "   - Enable the **Geocoding API**  \n",
        "   - Generate an **API Key**  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Insert the API Key into the Code**  \n",
        "   - The script will use this API key to query Google Maps and retrieve latitude/longitude.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Run the Script to Convert Addresses to Coordinates**  \n",
        "   - The code will process each address and store the coordinates for later use.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **🚀 How to Use This Project**  \n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Load the Data**  \n",
        "   - Ensure your dataset includes either **coordinates** or **addresses** (if you plan to extract them).  \n",
        "   - If missing coordinates, use the Google Maps API method to obtain them.  \n",
        "   - The script will automatically load and process the dataset into a **DataFrame**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Run the Route Optimization Algorithm**  \n",
        "   - The script will create clusters of **maximum 281 points** each.  \n",
        "   - It will then apply the **TSP algorithm** to determine the optimal visiting order.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Generate the CSV File and Visualize the Route**  \n",
        "   - Enter the **agent number** to generate a **route table**.  \n",
        "   - The script will generate a CSV file with the optimized route.  \n",
        "   - A **map will be displayed**, showing the numbered points in the correct order.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **📌 Key Features**  \n",
        "✔ **Efficient clustering** to distribute locations into manageable groups.  \n",
        "✔ **Route optimization** using the **Nearest Neighbor TSP algorithm**.  \n",
        "✔ **Automatic CSV generation** with sorted visiting orders.  \n",
        "✔ **Interactive map visualization** with numbered points.  \n",
        "✔ **Automatic coordinate retrieval** if not available.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **🎯 Expected Results**  \n",
        "- **A well-organized table** displaying the optimal visiting order.  \n",
        "- **An interactive map** showing points numbered in sequence.  \n",
        "- **A CSV file** with the ordered route for each agent.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **📊 Excel File Structure**  \n",
        "The Excel file used in this project must have the following structure:\n",

        "- The **columns** should start from the **2nd row** with these headers:\n",
